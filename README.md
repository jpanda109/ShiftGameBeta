README (ShiftGameBeta)
======================

A demo game based on two 2-dimensional worlds.
Created with the libgdx framework and the box2d physics engine.
Feel free to look and create your own games based on this one.

ShiftGame is a puzzle game centered around the ability to "shift" layers of dimensions in a 2D world. Use this ability to navigate through mazes or seemingly impassable obstacles. The player is controlled through fling gestures, with the amount of flings per level being limited so as to force the player to use an optimal strategy to complete the game.

LibGDX (http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/index.html) is a gamedev framework that essentially just consolidates a large portion of the nitty gritties of game development into an easy to use API.

This project uses Gradle as a project manager, so to successfully import this project, you must have Gradle (http://www.gradle.org/) installed. IntelliJ Idea and Android Studio both have native Gradle integration, so no changes are needed for those two IDEs.
Additionally, to run the html version, you must have GWT (http://www.gwtproject.org/), though sadly, they are severely lacking in Linux Support, so SuperDevMode is needed to run GWT projects on newer versions of Firefox for Linux.

Hope you guys enjoy!
